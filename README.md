# Volcano Variety

This mod is a patch for Advanced Biomes.   

In a nutshell this mod adds more tile location variety to the volcano biomes.   

In detail, this mod uses Harmony to patch the Advanced Biomes volcano biome's BiomeWorker code which makes these changes:   
* Allows volcano tiles to generate on small and large hills along side the normal mountainous and impassible tiles
* On top of that, it allows volcano tiles to generate on elevations higher than 750
   
This patch is just temporary. I am working with **Hey my team rules!** to add a mod option to toggle this feature.   

Thanks to Hey my team rules! for allowing me to publish this patch and giving me the original source to make the planned feature for Advanced Biomes.   
Please remember to rate this up if you like the mod!
